# Earthquake Visualization with Leaflet
This project uses the Leaflet JavaScript library to visualize earthquake data sourced from the USGS (United States Geological Survey). The goal of this visualization is to display real-time earthquake data on a map, with markers that reflect the magnitude and depth of the earthquakes. The map also includes popups with additional earthquake details and a legend for context.

# Features
Interactive Map: Earthquakes are plotted on the map using Leaflet, with markers corresponding to their geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude).
Magnitude and Depth Representation: Marker size reflects the magnitude of the earthquake, while color indicates its depth.
Popups: Each marker has an interactive popup that provides detailed information about the earthquake, such as location, magnitude, depth, and time.
Legend: A color-coded legend is included to provide context for earthquake depths.

# Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/ToniMak70/leaflet-challenge.git

2. Install Required Libraries
This project uses Leaflet.js to display the map. Ensure that you have an internet connection, as the project links to CDN versions of Leaflet for the map.
There is no installation process required for external libraries since Leaflet is linked directly in the HTML file. The libraries and data files are stored in the static and images folders.

3. Open the Map
To view the map:
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The map should load and display all the recent earthquakes as per the fetched data.
